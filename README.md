# Healthcare Assistant Chatbot 
The Healthcare Assistant Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users with healthcare-related queries. Built using Streamlit and Google's Gemini AI, this chatbot provides users with information on symptoms, medications, and appointments while ensuring a sleek and interactive user experience.

This project focuses on delivering quick and reliable health-related responses with a modern, elegant UI that includes smooth transitions, animations, and interactive elements. In case of critical health concerns, the chatbot displays a special warning urging users to seek immediate medical assistance.

## Features üöÄ

 - ü§ñ AI-powered chatbot using Gemini AI

 - üè• Provides responses to health queries, symptoms, and medication information

 - ‚ö†Ô∏è Displays critical case warnings for severe conditions

 - üé® Sleek dark-themed UI with elegant animations and transitions

 - üñ•Ô∏è Built with Streamlit for fast and responsive interactions

## How It Works

    1. Enter a health-related query in the text input box
    2. The chatbot analyzes the input and generates an appropriate response
    3. If a severe condition is detected (e.g., "chest pain"), a red warning is displayed
    4. The chatbot continuously improves by leveraging AI-driven responses
## Technologies Used
 - 	Programming Language: Python
 - Libraries & Frameworks:
 - 	NLP: Google Gemini API
 - 	Web Development: Streamlit
 - 	Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
 - 	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Health-Chatbot.git
cd AI_Health-Chatbot
```
 - Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install streamlit google-generativeai nltk
```
Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv healthcare-chatbot-env
```
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
```bash 
healthcare-chatbot-env\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash 
source healthcare-chatbot-env/bin/activate
```

Run the application:

```bash     
streamlit run healthcare_chatbot.py
```

Gemini API Key:

Ensure you have a valid Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.

    Replace "your-gemini-api-key" in the code with your actual API key.

## Future Enhancements
 - Future improvements can focus on integrating voice recognition and synthesis to enhance accessibility, allowing users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands.
- Expanding the chatbot's capabilities to support multiple languages will make it more inclusive and accessible to a diverse user base worldwide.
- Integrating real-time medical databases and AI-driven anomaly detection can improve the accuracy of responses and provide users with the latest healthcare insights.
- Deploying the chatbot on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud will enhance scalability and accessibility for a broader audience.
- Incorporating telemedicine services to connect users with healthcare professionals for virtual consultations can further enhance the chatbot‚Äôs impact.
